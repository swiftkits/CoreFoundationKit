## Installation

### Cocoapods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. [Learn More!](https://cocoapods.org/)
```ruby
pod 'CoreFoundationKit', '0.1.0'
```

### Swift package manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies. [Learn More!](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftkits/CoreFoundationKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

- How to setup `FileOperation`
```swift
let manager = FileManager.default
let rootDir = try! manager.url(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: false)

let directoryOperation = FileDirectoryOperation(manager: manager, rootDir: rootDir)
let fileOperations = FileOperation(directoryManager: directoryOperation)
```

- How to save file data into local file storage
```swift
let savedFile = try fileOperations.save(contentsOf: imageData, with: fileName)

//
// Returns
// FileItem with saved file info
//

savedFile.location // Local storage url of the file
savedFile.name     // Name of the file
savedFile.data     // data of the file

```

- How delete file from local storage
